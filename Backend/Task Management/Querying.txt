Querying in MongoDB using Mongoose

mongoose provides us with javascript method based querying that helps in implementing CRUD operations

CRUD

1. Create

1. await Model.create(data)

2. const newData = new Model(data);
    await newData.save();


2. Read Query 

a. Model.find() -> this sends a find query to the database without any condition

b. queries with conditions

Model.find({   -> array of objects 
    condition 
})

Model.findOne(condition) -> returns the first object that matches the condition


//matching multiple conditions

priority mid
status incomplete

LOGICAL OPERATORS


and &
or |
not ! 
nor

// exists in array

$in : array

in basically checks for the documents which have the field values mentioned in the array

$nin -> not in 


comparison OPERATORS


$gt : greater than
$gte : greater than equal to
$lt : less than
$lte : less than equal to
$ne: not equal to 


latency-> time taken by a request to send the data from the database to the client
the more the latency, the worse it is
lower latency helps in more scalability


pagination -> its the process of sending huge amounts of data in smaller chunks to reduce latency, to increase efficiency, and better performance


limit
skip 

total data = 100 

1 page  2 page   3page
1-10     11-20    21-30 ......



we always prefer updating the data using id 

- unqiue
- secure
- fast indexing
