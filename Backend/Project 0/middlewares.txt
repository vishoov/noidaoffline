REQ RES CYCLE -> HTTP 

Middlewares are those functions in express that are executed AFTER the request is recieved and BEFORE the handler function is called, middleware has access to req and res objects 

This is useful for the tasks that are required to be executed before the route sends a response


1. in built
2. application
3. custom 
4. security
5. external 

ways to implement a middleware function 

1. application level -> app.use(function) app.use implements a middleware function for each route that comes after it
2. route level middleware -> squeezed in middle of a route  
app.get("/data", middlewareFunc, (req, res)=>{});
