User management API

we have to build a server that delegates user related tasks

RESTful -> each route should be independent, stateless and organized

feature                         path                   method
1. signup                   /signup                      POST
2. login                    /LOGIN                      POST
3. logout                   /logout                     get
4. forgot password          /forgot                     POST
5. profile fetch            /profile/:id                GET
6. reset password           /reset                      PATCH
7. update information       /update                     PUT


MODEL -> SCHEMA AND VALIDATION
VIEW -> ROUTES
CONTROLLER -> HANDLER FUNCTIONS

Indexing through ID is the fastest
