Querying in MongoDB using Mongoose

mongoose provides us with javascript method based querying that helps in implementing CRUD operations

CRUD

1. Create

1. await Model.create(data)

2. const newData = new Model(data);
    await newData.save();


2. Read Query 

a. Model.find() -> this sends a find query to the database without any condition

b. queries with conditions

Model.find({
    condition 
})

Model.findOne(condition) -> returns the first object that matches the condition


//matching multiple conditions

priority mid
status incomplete

LOGICAL OPERATORS


and &
or |
not ! 
nor

// exists in array

$in : array

in basically checks for the documents which have the field values mentioned in the array

$nin -> not in
