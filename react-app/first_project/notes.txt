Why React?

-Reusability
-Simplification
-Modular Structure (Components)

- Virtual DOM -> login/not login 
- Declarative Programming 


React vs Other Frameworks:

- React vs Angular -> Angular full framework but react is a library
- React vs Vue: Vue has smaller ecosystem
-React vs Vanilla JS - Structure and maintainability is better 

Development Enviornment 


-Node.JS


node_modules -> helper files 
public -> files accessible by internet from our project 
src-> endpoint directory of the project


why create-react-app was depricated?



JSX  -> Javascript XML

it helps you write html like code in javascript files 
it makes it easier to write and understand react Components



KEYS

attributes 

Reusability 


component -> 
const todos = [
    {
        id:1, text:"Learn React"
    },{
        id:2, text:"Buy a ferrari"
    }
]

input -> submit -> todos push 


todos.map(
    'HTML'
)

const todoItems = todos.map(todo =>
  <li key={todo.id}>{todo.text}</li>
);


Learn React
Buy ferrari
Go to NYC 
go to dubai 


Keys in react are special attributes that are used touniquely identify elements in a list,
it helps in efficiently tracking the changes, removal and updates in the list and optimises the rendering process

How to use -> 1. list 
2. unique 


map-> index -> using array indexes is not recommended because if the list changes order, have items added, or removed, or changes, indexes will cause react to mis identify items 

Best practices:

- use a stable and unique values 
- key should not be same within siblings
- NEVER GENERATE A KEY ON THE FLY 
- Keys are used by React internally and ARE NOT PASSED TO COMPONENTS AS PROPS
