how to implement redux toolkit in react project


1. install redux and redux-toolkit
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

2. create a redux store

create store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
const store = configureStore({
    reducers:{}
})


3. wrap the application inside the store 
 import provider from redux, and store from the redux folder and wrap the whole application with the provider


4. feature building -> slices 

1 slice = 1 feature 


create a fetaures folder 
featureSlice.js 


name, initialState, reducers -> compulsary for creating a slice

export the reducers containing the actions


5. import the slice in the store

6. implement useDispatch and useSelector in the component where you want to use the actions
